Bottleneck description: --------------------
#1: The bottle neck is the WriteLine method in the Engine class. First it splits the message and joins it after that. String operations
wich are very slow and useless. After that is an unused variable c. The for cycle goest through the whole string a character at a time
and does not write the whole string together, which is also slow. It goes a fixed number of times (261 to be exact) through the cycle 
surrounding the Console.WriteLine method with try-catch block to catch a exception which will be thrown by the index of the array.
And finally there is a Thread.Sleep to slow down the process even more.
