# Wooden board

## Description

Steve owns a wooden board. He made his board special by writing several visible ASCII characters on it (codes from `33` to `126`). The resulting string formed palindrome (it is read the same way backwards).

Unfortunately, one day he broke his wooden board in half and lost one part. Help him to repair his biggest achievement in life, by writing a program which finds the minimum number of characters that need to be appended right of the board to form a palindrome.

## Input
- Input is read from the console
  - The characters on the broken wooden board on a single line

## Output
- Output should be printed on the console
  - Print a number on a single line - the minimum needed characters

## Constraints
- 1 <= **number of characters on the board** <= 500 000
- **See BGcoder for time and memory limits**
